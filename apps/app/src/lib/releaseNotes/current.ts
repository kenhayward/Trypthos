    summary:
      "First code drop. Sets up the Electron shell, the React renderer with its three-panel layout, and a pure TypeScript domain package - together with the release machinery every later PR relies on: version mirrors, release notes, and the guard tests that fail the build when any of them drift.",
    added: [
      "Electron desktop shell for Windows and macOS, loading the React renderer.",
      "Three-panel layout: workspace browser, editor, and AI chat.",
      "Workspace path guard, shared by every storage backend, with the escape cases pinned by tests.",
      "Schema-versioned persistence with migrations, so stored data survives upgrades.",
      "Chat profile configuration: endpoint, model and parameters, with API keys deliberately excluded from settings files.",
      "Continuous integration on every push and pull request.",
      "In-app release notes and About box.",
    ],
