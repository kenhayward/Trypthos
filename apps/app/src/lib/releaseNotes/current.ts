    headline: "A real markdown editor: Source and Preview",
    summary:
      "The centre panel is now a working editor. Source shows every character of your markdown, colour-coded by role, with line numbers and undo. Preview renders the same text as prose. Switching between them never changes your file - the two views read the same bytes, which is what lets someone reading a document and someone maintaining it share it without either being surprised.",

      "Markdown editing in the centre panel, built on CodeMirror 6.",
      "Source view: every character visible, colour-coded so markers stay dim and headings, emphasis, code and links stand out.",
      "Preview view: read-only rendered prose, with markdown sanitised before it is displayed.",
      "A view switcher in the editor header.",

      "The centre panel opens on a scratch buffer instead of a placeholder, so the editor can be used before folder support lands.",

    headline: "Project scaffold, CI and release machinery",
    summary:
      "First code drop. Sets up the Electron shell, the React renderer with its three-panel layout, and a pure TypeScript domain package - together with the release machinery every later PR relies on: version mirrors, release notes, and the guard tests that fail the build when any of them drift.",

      "Schema-versioned persistence with migrations, so stored data survives upgrades.",
